# AWS Upload Demo

# Introduction

- This repository will be my following this video series [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-hoSg8iRG0)
    - This repository is for me to refresh my skills using Spring Boot and React JS.
    - I will also be uploading another repository where I follow a Spring Security course from the same author.
    - Upon finishing both of these courses I will create a boiler plate Spring Boot web application with Spring Security.
        - I will decide the details of the boiler plate application.
        
# Branches
    - This video course has a table of contents with timestamps so I will be creating branches to follow that style.
    - My initial upload will be before the AWS credentials are put in.
